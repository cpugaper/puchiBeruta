<h1 align="center">PuchiBeruta</h1>

<strong>In this second release,</strong> we have extended the functionalities of our game engine, <strong>PuchiBeruta</strong>, by integrating a full scene editor and several essential optimisations. This engine is developed using the SDL2, OpenGL, Assimp, DevIL, ImGui and Cereal libraries. In this phase, we have implemented all the features required in the first and second releases, including:

- <strong>Scene editor:</strong> tools to manage GameObjects with hierarchies, transformations (translate, rotate, scale), mesh and texture mapping, and camera setup.
- <strong>In-world selection:</strong> GameObjects can be selected directly in the scene using the mouse.
- <strong>Frustum Culling:</strong> with real-time visualisation for improved performance and debugging.
- <strong>Resource management:</strong> a system that automatically organises assets, saves meshes and textures in a custom format, and ensures efficient use of memory.
- <strong>Scene serialisation:</strong> to save and load complete configurations.
- <strong>Controlled simulation:</strong> options to smoothly start, pause and stop the simulation.
